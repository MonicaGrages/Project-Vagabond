# Project Vagabond

Project Vagabond is an user-friendly app that can be used to create posts directed to the city that it is referring to. Users have the ability to sign up with an e-mail. Each users has their own profile page that displays all recent posts made by that person with most recent post first. Users also have the ability to view each city's page to see what other people have posted. Users can view what posts they may have written.
